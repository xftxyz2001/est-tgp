1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,200
The biggest living thing

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,960
that exists on this planet
is a plant...

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,600
..like this giant sequoia tree
in California.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,360
Plants, whether they are enormous,
like this one,

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,960
or microscopic,
are the basis of all life,

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,280
including ourselves.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,520
We depend upon them for
every mouthful of food that we eat

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,640
and every lung full of air
that we breathe.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,360
Plants flourish
in remarkable ways,

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,640
yet, for the most part,

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,840
the secrets of their world
have been hidden from us...

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,640
..until now.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
CRACKING

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,720
Now we have new ground-breaking
technology that enables us

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
to enter their extraordinary
world

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,280
and see their lives
from their perspective.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,520
This series will reveal
the extraordinary

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,840
and dramatic ways in which
plants behave...

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,960
..and we will explore
the challenges demanded by

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,560
the very different landscapes
in which they live.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,480
The tropics.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,280
The richest
and most competitive place

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
in which to survive.

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,840
The bizarre water world...

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,120
..where giants
fight ferocious battles,

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,040
and plants eat animals alive.

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Deserts...

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
Agh!

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,160
A world of extremes.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Seasonal lands...

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
..where survival depends
on precision timing.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,560
And everywhere,
we will explore the critical

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,440
and intimate relationships
between plants and animals,

34
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,000
including ourselves.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,280
Join me in a world
that takes you by surprise...

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,640
CHUCKLES

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
..and see our planet
as never before...

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
..from
the plants' perspective.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,880
This is The Green Planet.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,440
BIRDS AND ANIMALS CALL

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm in Costa Rica,
in the heart of a rainforest,

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
the richest and most dynamic
environment on Earth.

43
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Rainforests only cover
a very small proportion

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,240
of the Earth's surface,

45
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,120
yet they contain over half
of all known

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,160
species of animals
and plants.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,960
Up here, the forest's canopy is
bathed by life-giving sunlight.

48
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,080
The branches of the great trees

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,680
carry rich, flourishing
sky gardens...

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,040
..home to countless different
kinds of beautiful plants.

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
Each species has evolved
its own exquisite solution

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,480
to the challenges of survival.

53
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,160
This forest world
may look peaceful,

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
timeless and unchanging,

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
but that is far from the truth.

56
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
This is a battlefield.

57
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
Throughout this forest,
plants are competing ferociously

58
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
with one another
to claim the light.

59
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,640
The battle is at its fiercest
on the forest floor...

60
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,880
..where only 2% of the sunlight
filters through.

61
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,160
Plants here have to
bide their time.

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,200
Their opportunity comes
when an old tree dies.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,960
When that happens,
sunlight floods the forest floor

64
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,920
for the first time
in perhaps 100 years.

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,640
The seedling's wait is over.

66
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,200
It must now race skywards

67
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,440
and claim a place
in the canopy.

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
But it's not alone.

69
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,880
RUSTLING

70
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,440
Rivals are everywhere,

71
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,840
each with its own
survival strategy.

72
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,160
Some plants,
like this monstera,

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,640
stretch out divided leaves
to collect what light they can.

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,440
This vine is groping blindly
around with its tendrils.

75
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,360
It attempts to reach the light
by hitching a ride.

76
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
Its tendrils are highly
sensitive to touch.

77
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,880
And a suitable target
is in range.

78
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
Got it!

79
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
The vine tightens its grip

80
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,640
and begins to haul itself
upwards.

81
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,840
But it's now overtaken

82
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,240
by the forest's
fastest-growing tree.

83
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
A young balsa.

84
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,200
Its giant leaves are already
40cm across

85
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,680
and are stealing the light
from its rivals below.

86
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,280
But the balsa's battle
is not yet won.

87
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,520
Other, different vines
are lying in wait.

88
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Each is armed with dozens
of claw-like hooks.

89
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,920
If just one hook gets a grip,

90
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
the vine will be able
to smother its victim.

91
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,000
But the balsa is defended
by a shield of slippery hairs.

92
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,680
The vine's hooks
just can't get a hold.

93
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,720
The balsa brushes them aside...

94
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,440
..and continues to rush
skywards...

95
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,880
..leaving the losers
in its shadow

96
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,680
to fight among themselves.

97
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,160
This balsa has won its battle
for the light.

98
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,960
And it's done so
in a little over a year.

99
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,560
Most trees would have grown
an inch or so in that time,

100
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,120
but this one is already
30 feet - 10 metres - tall.

101
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Balsas owe their success

102
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,480
to the special character
of their wood.

103
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,600
If this section of tree trunk
came from a hardwood tree,

104
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
it would be really quite heavy.

105
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,680
But as it is,

106
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
it's from balsa,

107
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
and it's really very light,

108
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
and that's because of
its internal structure.

109
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Under the microscope,
balsawood looks like a honeycomb.

110
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,080
It contains more air than wood,

111
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
so, not only
can it grow very fast,

112
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,440
but it gets the maximum height
for minimum weight.

113
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,360
But fast growth needs
something else.

114
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
Fuel...

115
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
..and lots of it.

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,080
That fuel is created
in a plant's leaves,

117
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,000
as they soak up the sun.

118
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
It's a process called
photosynthesis...

119
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,360
..a chemical reaction that is
the basis of all life on Earth.

120
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,120
Leaves are covered by thousands
of microscopic pores

121
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
called stomata.

122
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,360
When open, they extract
carbon dioxide from the air,

123
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,480
and, using energy from the sun,

124
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,400
combine it with nutrients
to build the plant's tissues.

125
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,520
And critically for us,
the process releases the oxygen

126
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,960
that we and all animals need
in order to breathe.

127
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,840
BIRD CALLS

128
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,320
But for plants,
there is a downside.

129
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,840
These precious, energy-packed
leaves attract predators...

130
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,960
..in every shape...

131
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
..size...

132
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,960
..and agility.

133
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,400
A sloth can only move slowly,

134
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,040
but you don't need speed
to gather leaves,

135
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,200
and it eats nothing else.

136
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,440
The plants here are
under constant attack

137
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,640
from all kinds of leaf-eaters,

138
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,520
but the most voracious by far
is hardly ever seen.

139
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,000
It consumes 50,000 leaves
every day.

140
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,240
It's created this great clearing
in the forest...

141
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
..and it lives
just beneath my feet.

142
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,440
It's called leucoagaricus.

143
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
It's neither animal nor plant.

144
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,440
It's a fungus.

145
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,640
It lives five metres
underground,

146
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,000
far from the leaves
that it devours.

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,520
To get them,

148
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,920
it employs the best
leaf-gatherers in the tropics.

149
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,880
Leafcutter ants.

150
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,320
Millions of them provide
the fungus with its food,

151
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,360
and in return, the fungus
cultivates tiny mushrooms

152
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
as food for the ants.

153
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,800
The fungus releases
chemical signals

154
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,480
that tell the worker ants what
type of leaf it wants to eat.

155
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,600
Scouts are sent out
with the latest orders.

156
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
Worker ants will travel
hundreds of metres

157
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,960
to find the right kind.

158
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,600
Today's crop is being taken
from a young bixa tree.

159
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,640
Just a few years old and
still battling to reach the canopy,

160
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,160
it can ill afford to lose
any of its leaves.

161
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,160
CRUNCHING AND SLICING

162
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,720
Between them, the ants can
demolish a large leaf

163
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,280
in a matter of minutes.

164
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,040
The sound of cutting attracts
more ants.

165
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Now the pieces are carried back
to the underground fungus.

166
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,400
The ants can run at speeds
of two metres a minute.

167
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,640
And each can carry a load
ten times its own weight.

168
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,200
It's a river of leaves
across the jungle floor...

169
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,000
..part of a vast network
that extends for miles

170
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,360
through the forest.

171
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,040
To avoid congestion,

172
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,000
worker ants dig trenches
around obstacles.

173
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,960
Thousands of pieces
are delivered every hour

174
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,600
to the waiting fungus.

175
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,800
Fed by
such a continuous supply,

176
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,720
the fungus grows rapidly,

177
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,480
filling the chambers
in which it lives...

178
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,800
..so, the ants excavate
more space.

179
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,400
It seems that the fungus
has the upper hand...

180
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,160
..and the bixa tree
will not survive.

181
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,080
But it fights back...

182
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,400
..using chemical warfare.

183
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,520
The bixa tree floods its leaves
with toxins

184
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,680
that could kill
the distant fungus.

185
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,080
As the ants carry the fragments
back, they are themselves

186
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,680
poisoning the fungus
on the tree's behalf.

187
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
It's a long-distance attack.

188
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,680
As the poison takes effect,
the ants sense

189
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,640
that their fungus
is weakening...

190
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,000
..and they respond
to its signals

191
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
by changing to another
source of leaves.

192
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,160
So, the plant's
chemical response

193
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,240
forces the ants to constantly
switch from tree to tree.

194
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,280
Strike and counterstrike.

195
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,440
And that ensures that enough
leaves remain uneaten

196
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,920
for each tree to recover.

197
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
BIRDS AND ANIMALS CALL

198
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,200
Once a plant becomes adult,

199
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,240
it can switch its energies

200
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,000
from growth to reproduction.

201
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,000
The tropical forests of the Americas
stretch from Mexico

202
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to the southern reaches
of the Amazon.

203
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,560
They contain more than 100,000
different species of plants,

204
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,200
each with its own particular
survival strategy.

205
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,120
One species that has adopted
a grow-fast lifestyle

206
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,440
flourishes throughout
this vast region.

207
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,520
The balsa.

208
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,480
But it has to pay a high price
for doing so.

209
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,320
The lightweight wood
that enables it

210
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,000
to grow at such speed
is not strong

211
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,840
and is easily broken.

212
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,720
Few balsas live
longer than 20 years.

213
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,280
This one is approaching
the end of its brief life,

214
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,320
so, the time has come for it
to reproduce.

215
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,120
It has used a huge amount
of energy to produce

216
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,400
some of the most extravagant flowers
in the forest,

217
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
in immense numbers.

218
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,720
Each is the size
of a human hand.

219
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
As night falls,

220
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
the tree prepares
an enticing treat.

221
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
This is a kinkajou,

222
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
a kind of fruit-eating racoon.

223
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,000
Each flower is filled
with huge quantities

224
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,720
of exceptionally rich nectar,

225
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,560
supercharged with sugar.

226
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,440
Irresistible!

227
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,400
The kinkajous drink so greedily

228
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,600
that they get pollen
all over their faces.

229
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,160
So, as they move
from tree to tree,

230
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,240
they carry pollen with them.

231
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,840
But the balsa
leaves little to chance.

232
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,560
The nectar might appear
to have run out,

233
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,880
but this is just
the first round.

234
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,760
Now the balsa refills
its flowers,

235
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,760
enticing the kinkajous back
to repeat the process...

236
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
..seven times a night.

237
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,880
Pollination is complete.

238
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,800
And the kinkajous -
they also get well served,

239
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,320
with over 100 pints of nectar
in just a few weeks.

240
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,400
Both plant and animal do well
out of this arrangement.

241
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,480
But in the tropical world,
that isn't always so.

242
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
BIRDS AND ANIMALS CALL

243
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,480
Borneo.

244
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,760
Here, on the slopes
of Mount Kinabalu,

245
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,800
live plants that eat animals

246
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
using pitcher-shaped leaves
full of water.

247
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,680
Insects are attracted
by the expectation of nectar,

248
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,280
but tumble into the pitcher,

249
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,440
where they are drowned
and absorbed.

250
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,080
On the lower slopes
of the mountain,

251
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,840
a plant grows
that has no leaves at all.

252
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
Or even a stem.

253
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
All that can be seen is this -

254
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
a bud.

255
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,760
It is a parasite.

256
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
RUSTLING

257
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,000
The rest of its body lies
within the tissues of a liana,

258
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,720
on which it feeds.

259
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,200
After about five years,

260
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,880
the bud finally opens
into a monstrous flower.

261
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,720
It now has only a day or so
in which to be pollinated

262
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,880
before it starts to wither.

263
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,000
Its petals are
the colour of blood.

264
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Their surface is tough
and warty.

265
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
It appears to have fur.

266
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,360
Even whiskers and teeth.

267
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,840
At first sight, it might be
mistaken for a dead animal.

268
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,120
This is rafflesia,
the corpse flower.

269
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,400
A metre across,
it's the world's biggest flower.

270
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
And this one is a male.

271
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,920
From its centre comes
the pungent odour of death.

272
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,480
It's a scent that might not appeal
to every animal.

273
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
But it's very attractive
to carrion flies.

274
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,720
They lay their eggs
on rotting flesh.

275
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,280
FLIES BUZZ

276
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,720
The scent lures the fly
deep into the flower

277
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,600
in search of meat.

278
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,560
The fly finds nothing.

279
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,760
The rafflesia, however, has the fly
exactly where it wants it.

280
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
It's stuck pollen
to the fly's back.

281
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,160
If this male rafflesia's
strategy is to work,

282
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,160
the fly carrying its pollen
must now visit

283
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,760
a female corpse flower...

284
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,520
..such as this one.

285
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,600
FLY BUZZES

286
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
Success!

287
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Once pollinated,
plants are able to produce seeds,

288
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,920
the next generation,

289
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,760
but once again, there are animals
all over the forest

290
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
that are eager to make
a meal of them.

291
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,960
BIRDS CALL

292
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,320
The Malay Archipelago,

293
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,680
a vast tropical world
of 1,000 islands.

294
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,680
It's home to giants -

295
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,240
the tallest trees
in the tropics,

296
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
many of which live
for centuries.

297
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
They produce seeds
in enormous numbers,

298
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,920
but only do so
when the time is right.

299
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,120
This individual hasn't produced
a single seed

300
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
for nearly a decade,

301
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
but in the last weeks,
it has become festooned

302
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
with more than 10,000 of them.

303
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
Each seed has the potential
to produce a giant,

304
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,960
like its parent.

305
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,080
But success will depend...

306
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,280
..on timing.

307
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,120
SNORTS

308
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,960
Seed-hunters are gathering.

309
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,600
Bearded pigs.

310
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
GRUNTS

311
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,640
But these seeds have been
produced by a dipterocarp...

312
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,000
..trees that create
the tropical world's

313
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,680
largest seed nursery.

314
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,320
After years of waiting,

315
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,680
thousands upon thousands
of individual dipterocarps

316
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,840
have synchronised to produce
the next generation,

317
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,920
all at exactly the same time.

318
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
BIRDS CALL

319
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,680
And now these seeds will face
the dangers below together.

320
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,360
By releasing billions of seeds
all at the same time,

321
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,680
they swamp the pigs
and any other animals

322
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,960
with more than they could
possibly eat.

323
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,680
And that buys time for
some of the seeds to take root

324
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,520
and sprout.

325
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,200
CRACKLING

326
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,520
The tree's strategy has worked.

327
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,640
But a seedling will have to overcome
many more dangers

328
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,160
over the years if it, too,
is to become a giant.

329
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
And there are many ways
in a tropical forest

330
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,320
by which a tree's life
can be ended

331
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,680
before it reaches its prime.

332
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,360
The northernmost tip
of Australia.

333
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,560
This is the world's
most ancient rainforest.

334
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,400
BIRDS AND ANIMALS CALL

335
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,680
LOW GRUNTS

336
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,000
Battles between animals
and plants

337
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,840
have raged here
for 180 million years.

338
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,680
LOW CREAKING

339
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,840
So, the plants have had time
to develop effective defences.

340
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,480
This is a poison arrow tree,

341
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,960
one of the tropical world's
most heavily defended plants.

342
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,440
Its trunk is tall and slippery

343
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,360
and exudes a poisonous sap.

344
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
It appears to be
almost invulnerable.

345
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
But even so,

346
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,360
just as this individual
reaches maturity,

347
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,560
its life has become endangered.

348
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,440
BIRDS TWEET

349
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
Each monsoon season,

350
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,680
it is invaded from above.

351
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,160
It attracts
hundreds of shining starlings.

352
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,880
Its immense smooth trunk
makes its high branches above

353
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,400
a safe place to nest,

354
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,040
but over the years,

355
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,600
this has created
a major problem for the tree.

356
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,720
After feeding, the starlings
return to the nest

357
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
to digest their food,

358
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,480
with inevitable consequences.

359
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,200
Every year,

360
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,320
they produce almost a quarter
of a ton of droppings.

361
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,760
The toxic chemicals
they contain

362
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
create a dead zone that
completely surrounds the tree.

363
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,800
The toxins are absorbed
by its roots

364
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,200
and travel up through the trunk
and into every leaf.

365
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,160
CRASHING

366
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,480
Branch by branch,

367
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,080
the tree is slowly dying.

368
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,520
It has become a victim
of its own success.

369
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
It has been poisoned.

370
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,200
Now a new battle begins...

371
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,400
..one to claim the tree's
dead body

372
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,920
and the vast amount of nutrients
that it contains.

373
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,720
It's a battle that is fought
throughout the natural world...

374
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,080
..involving a group
of organisms

375
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,560
that we rarely notice.

376
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,760
Here, on the floor
of a tropical rainforest,

377
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,560
it's dark, it's humid

378
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,240
and it's hot -

379
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,640
ideal conditions for fungi.

380
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,520
We normally think of fungi
as things like this.

381
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,920
Mushrooms of one kind
or another.

382
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,360
But these are just
the fruiting bodies.

383
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,520
They exist for most of the time

384
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,120
hidden in the leaf litter
and the earth

385
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,440
as a network
of fine white threads.

386
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,320
The threads of competing fungi
envelop their victim's body,

387
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,040
releasing enzymes which digest
the tree's tissues

388
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,560
and unlock the nutrients within.

389
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,720
There a million or so
different species of fungi

390
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,000
in the tropics.

391
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,240
Some feed on dead plants.

392
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,000
Others eat them alive.

393
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,080
And some reveal their existence
in an eerily beautiful way.

394
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,440
In Africa, in the Congo,

395
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,360
this is known
as chimpanzee fire.

396
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,080
The mysterious
bioluminescent glow

397
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,720
becomes brighter as the fungus
digests the tree.

398
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,400
When fungi have fed
sufficiently,

399
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,840
they develop
their reproductive organs.

400
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,320
Each can produce
literally billions of spores...

401
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,160
..the tiny particles

402
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,400
that carry the species'
genetic blueprint.

403
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,320
Each spore like this

404
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,840
has the potential
to kill a tree.

405
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
SPORES RUSTLE

406
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,600
The spores are so light

407
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,280
they can be carried by
the slightest air currents.

408
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,720
At least a billion

409
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,680
float above every square metre
of rainforest.

410
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,800
Recently, it has been
discovered that these spores

411
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,200
do far more than just
bring death and decay.

412
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,040
They are, in fact,
at the very centre

413
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,640
of the rainforest's
life support system.

414
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
WIND WHISTLES

415
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,560
High in the humid air,

416
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,440
the spores combine
with molecules of water.

417
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,280
RUMBLING

418
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,240
Gradually,
they collect into droplets,

419
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,440
which,
when they are heavy enough, fall...

420
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,880
THUNDER CRACKS

421
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,360
..as rain.

422
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,480
Over two-and-a-half metres
of rain falls every year

423
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,280
in a rainforest.

424
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,040
And in the centre
of almost every raindrop,

425
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,800
there is a fungal spore.

426
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,400
The world's rainforests
are the richest

427
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,560
and most dynamic environments
on Earth,

428
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,440
built on complex connections
and relationships.

429
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,760
BIRDS SQUAWK

430
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,240
But these connections,

431
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,880
competitive or collaborative,

432
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,440
are now becoming
increasingly fragile.

433
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,600
THUNDER RUMBLES

434
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
THUNDER CRASHES

435
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,680
When Charles Darwin was exploring
the tropical world

436
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,920
nearly 200 years ago,

437
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,080
he wrote this in his diary.

438
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,800
"Among the scenes which are
deeply impressed on my mind,

439
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,120
"none exceed in sublimity

440
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,440
"the primeval forests
undefaced by the hand of man."

441
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,040
He would struggle to find
such a place today.

442
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,680
Today, 70% of all the world's
rainforest plants

443
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,920
grow within a mile of a road
or a clearing

444
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,120
that we have cut into the forest...

445
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,720
..and this is creating
new battlefields

446
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,440
in the tropical world.

447
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,240
Alien armies of identical
cultivated plants

448
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,080
now stand where thousands
of different species once grew.

449
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,240
We have planted
vast regiments of crops

450
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,760
in order to provide ourselves

451
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,960
with food
and other commodities...

452
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,600
..and the ancient forest
has been reduced

453
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,320
to ever fewer isolated fragments.

454
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,840
All, however, is not lost.

455
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,480
The fragments
can still be sanctuaries,

456
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,680
keeping alive the intimate
relationships within them.

457
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,200
Their size is
nonetheless critical.

458
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,560
This is the seven-hour flower.

459
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,640
This plant produces its flowers
at night.

460
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,400
They open about six o'clock,

461
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,040
and each blossom only lasts
that night.

462
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,680
It opens for about seven hours

463
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,120
and then it dies.

464
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,720
But during that time,
it provides food

465
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,440
for one particular animal.

466
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,360
SOFTLY

467
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,360
A bat.

468
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,760
And here it is!

469
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,760
CHUCKLES

470
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,440
During the seven-hour flower's
flowering season...

471
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,480
..Underwood's bat feeds
almost exclusively on its nectar.

472
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,280
It is the plant's
primary pollinator.

473
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,880
It might seem that this is

474
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,800
a fairly evenly balanced
relationship,

475
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,160
but not so.

476
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,720
The bat likes this nectar
because it's sweet,

477
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,120
but it's not very nourishing.

478
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,080
So the bat must visit
hundreds of flowers a night...

479
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,200
..and it pollinates them
as if feeds.

480
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,480
But if a patch of forest
becomes too small,

481
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,280
with too few flowers,

482
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,400
the bats will disappear,

483
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,880
and without the bats,
the flowers can't reproduce

484
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,520
and will soon die out.

485
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,720
The partnership is broken.

486
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,640
Life in the forest depends on
countless close relationships,

487
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,400
but they are increasingly
under threat

488
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,040
as forests become more fragmented.

489
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,520
The solution, of course,

490
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,240
is to join these remaining
fragments together again.

491
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,600
30 years ago,
I came to this exact spot.

492
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,320
This land belonged to

493
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,440
a scientific research
establishment

494
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,120
and it was covered with grass
being grazed by cattle.

495
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,120
The scientists
got rid of the cattle

496
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,400
and allowed nature
to take its course.

497
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,160
Just look at it now!

498
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,480
This new forest
has become a bridge

499
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,440
that connects several fragments,

500
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,880
allowing plants and animals
to both renew old connections

501
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,720
and create fresh ones.

502
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,920
Of course,
we urgently need to protect

503
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,080
what healthy forests still remain.

504
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,240
But looking forward,

505
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,600
we must take what may well be
our last chance

506
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,120
to re-establish
the lost rainforest...

507
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,720
..and help the tropical world
to heal itself.

508
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,080
It will take the co-operation
of nations around the world,

509
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,360
but it is the only way in which
we'll be able to

510
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,840
preserve the treasures
of the tropical rainforest

511
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,160
for future generations.

512
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,200
And with it,

513
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,800
ultimately protect all life
on this,

514
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,600
our green planet.

515
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,440
The aim of The Green Planet team
was to take the viewer

516
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,240
into the world of plants,
so that it could be seen

517
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,000
from the plants' perspective

518
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,200
in a way that had not been
possible till now.

519
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,640
That meant developing
an entirely new camera system.

520
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,040
And this is the game-changer -

521
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,080
a specially designed
robot camera

522
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,720
that we affectionately call
"the Triffid".

523
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,840
The Triffid started life
in the garage of an American

524
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,640
ex-military engineer,
Chris Field.

525
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,120
<font color="#ffff00">I'd seen quite a few of these</font>

526
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,320
<font color="#ffff00">Planet Earth style</font>
<font color="#ffff00">documentaries,</font>

527
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,120
<font color="#ffff00">and they always absolutely</font>
<font color="#ffff00">blew my mind,</font>

528
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,440
<font color="#ffff00">especially the botanic time-lapse</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really spoke to me.</font>

529
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,360
In his spare time,
Chris spent a decade

530
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,840
building elaborate
motion-controlled

531
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,000
time-lapse camera rigs

532
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,560
and teaching himself
how to film plants.

533
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,440
<font color="#ffff00">Plants often behave like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">animals in so many ways,</font>

534
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,080
<font color="#ffff00">and being able to see it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">through time-lapse is one thing</font>

535
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,320
<font color="#ffff00">but using the motion-control</font>
<font color="#ffff00">brings you into that timescale.</font>

536
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,160
<font color="#00ffff">We could really see the potential</font>

537
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
<font color="#00ffff">in how we could use</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this sort of movement</font>

538
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
<font color="#00ffff">to bring plants alive</font>

539
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,640
<font color="#00ffff">and film them in the same way</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that we film animals.</font>

540
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,840
Soon, Chris joins the team

541
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,440
in a quiet corner
of the Devon countryside

542
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,400
and the robot army begins
to take shape.

543
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,160
WHIRRING

544
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,680
<font color="#00ff00">After 40 years</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of filming time-lapse,</font>

545
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,040
<font color="#00ff00">these rigs have opened up</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a whole new world for us.</font>

546
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,440
<font color="#00ff00">So, it'll be like</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hovering around something</font>

547
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,120
<font color="#00ff00">with a drone or helicopter,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but in a time-lapse speed.</font>

548
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,640
<font color="#00ffff">The holy grail for us is being</font>
<font color="#00ffff">able to take this technology</font>

549
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,000
<font color="#00ffff">out into the wild, try and get</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the same sorts of dynamic moves</font>

550
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,720
<font color="#00ffff">in some of the most extreme</font>
<font color="#00ffff">environments in the world.</font>

551
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,880
<font color="#00ffff">So, what we needed to do</font>

552
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,840
<font color="#00ffff">was to develop this technology</font>
<font color="#00ffff">even further.</font>

553
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,360
Six months later,
the Triffid is born...

554
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,000
..and with slight trepidation,
they hand me the controls.

555
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
That makes it go away.

556
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,760
And this makes it come back.

557
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,360
And this sends it up.

558
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,040
Ooh!

559
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,280
CHUCKLES

560
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,040
I think I'd better hand it over
to the experts.

561
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,120
CHUCKLES

562
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,680
Now it's time to put
this new member of the team

563
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,400
properly through its paces.

564
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,080
WHIRRING

565
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,880
<font color="#00ffff">The aim here is for Ollie</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to find a target, aim for it</font>

566
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,320
<font color="#00ffff">and fly through it,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as if he is a tiny fly</font>

567
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,720
<font color="#00ffff">going through a hole in a leaf.</font>

568
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,960
Easier said than done.

569
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,200
<font color="#00ffff">Oops!</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm trying to find a target.</font>

570
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,840
<font color="#00ff00">Whether the kit's going to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">stand up to that sort of use</font>

571
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,640
<font color="#00ff00">and the abuse that we throw</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at most pieces of kit</font>

572
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,200
<font color="#00ff00">has yet to be seen.</font>

573
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,760
<font color="#00ff00">In the studio, it seems to be</font>
<font color="#00ff00">working pretty well.</font>

574
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,360
But this is only
a dress rehearsal.

575
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,000
It's time for the Triffid
to face the challenges

576
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,440
of the Costa Rican rainforest,

577
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,360
and leafcutter ants.

578
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,320
<font color="#ffff00">We want to film their journey</font>
<font color="#ffff00">all the way</font>

579
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,800
<font color="#ffff00">down the trunk</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and along this buttress root</font>

580
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,280
<font color="#ffff00">and down to their nest.</font>

581
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,320
The team and the Triffid
need several days

582
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,800
of dry weather,

583
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,400
but a storm can hit
at any moment...

584
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,600
THUNDER RUMBLES

585
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,160
..and rain is one thing
the Triffid does not like.

586
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,760
<font color="#00ffff">The conditions</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that we're working in now</font>

587
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,320
<font color="#00ffff">are a little bit more</font>
<font color="#00ffff">challenging than the studio.</font>

588
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">All the ground is really bumpy.</font>

589
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,680
<font color="#ffff00">We've got loads of plants</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the way.</font>

590
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,960
<font color="#ffff00">I know we're making a series</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about plants,</font>

591
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,520
<font color="#ffff00">but sometimes they're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a complete pain in the neck!</font>

592
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,120
The Triffid needs to be
programmed

593
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,920
to capture images from 7,000
different camera positions

594
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,240
on the ants' trail.

595
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,880
Just one drop of rain
on the lens,

596
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,080
or a wobble,

597
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,280
and the whole process
will have to start again.

598
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,160
<font color="#ffff00">I think this is when</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we're going to find out</font>

599
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,680
<font color="#ffff00">if our ambition</font>
<font color="#ffff00">outweighs our ability.</font>

600
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,720
For the crew,
the ambition is certainly high.

601
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,240
RUSTLING

602
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,080
Fortunately, it's all down
to the Triffid now.

603
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,160
<font color="#ffff00">We've been filming the ants</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with the Triffid</font>

604
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,840
<font color="#ffff00">for eight days now,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and we're on our third set-up.</font>

605
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's pretty slow going.</font>

606
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,080
While the Triffid seems to be
handling the pressure well,

607
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,800
for the crew, trying to take
a tree's-eye view of ants

608
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,120
is turning into
a bit of a nightmare.

609
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,120
<font color="#ffff00">Wake up, film ants,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">go to sleep, dream of ants.</font>

610
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,240
<font color="#ffff00">Wake up, film ants, sleep,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">dream of ants.</font>

611
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,000
<font color="#ffff00">Wake up, film ants,</font>

612
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,720
<font color="#ffff00">go to sleep, dream of ants.</font>

613
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,760
After two weeks in the jungle,

614
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,920
ambition and ability
finally come together,

615
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,200
for the Triffid, at least.

616
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,840
Thousands of individual images

617
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,280
creating a single
extraordinary time-lapse...

618
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,600
..one that follows
a river of leaves

619
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,440
across the jungle floor
from a unique perspective.

620
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,200
For the Triffid,
this was just the beginning.

621
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,680
Take a bow, Triffid.

622
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,560
WHIRRING

623
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,440
Next time on The Green Planet...

624
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,200
..the wonder of water worlds...

625
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,840
..where plants hunt...

626
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,160
..go on the move...

627
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,640
..fight...

628
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,520
..and create the air we breathe.

629
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,960
The Open University
have produced a poster

630
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,640
